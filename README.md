## Overview  
The **University Course Management System** is a fully functional SQL-based project designed to demonstrate advanced database concepts including:

- Database design & normalization  
- Table creation with proper keys & constraints  
- CRUD operations  
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)  
- Subqueries  
- Aggregations & filtering (GROUP BY, HAVING)  
- String, date, and numeric manipulation  
- Window functions  
- SQL CASE expressions  

This project simulates the core data operations required to run a **university academic system**.

##  Project Objectives  
This project aims to:

- Build a complete and normalized relational database system  
- Demonstrate all major SQL operations in a real-world use case  
- Handle student enrollments, course assignments, instructor mapping, and department structure  
- Practice advanced SQL queries on realistic data  
- Provide a working `.sql` file that can be executed in any MySQL 8.x environment

The system includes **five main entities**:

1. **Students** – personal info, enrollment info  
2. **Courses** – course catalog  
3. **Departments** – university academic departments  
4. **Instructors** – teaching faculty
